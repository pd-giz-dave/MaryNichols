    <p>THE SUMMER HOUSE by Mary Nichols spans World Wars 1 and 2, metropolis and village, big house and slum terrace.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was a time of enormous change, in social conventions, moral values, class structures and education and one of the many delights of this book is the author&rsquo;s unobtrusive but faultless sense of place and time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Essentially, this is the story of&nbsp;tragedy in three women&rsquo;s lives &ndash; and how they survive and grow afterwards.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;constraints of the times affect the practical outcomes.&nbsp; But the feelings, described here with a restraint that makes them all the more painful, &nbsp;are universal.&nbsp; During the Great War young Lady Helen marries a&nbsp;man her family feels at home with and then,&nbsp;finding him&nbsp;a stranger, falls in love with someone else.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her family cannot permit her to keep a child that is not her husband&rsquo;s, so she is hustled into something close to&nbsp;prison&nbsp;until the birth and then the child is taken away.&nbsp; The&nbsp;moral disdain of those employed to help her through the birth is chilling but the withdrawal of affection from her family is worse and rings heartbreakingly true.&nbsp;&nbsp; Eventually, widowed and orphaned by the War, Helen sets out to find her daughter.&nbsp; But&nbsp;the lies she has been told, and holes in the records make it&nbsp; very difficult &ndash; and when she does, she has to confront a whole&nbsp;human dilemma.</p>
<p>Anne&nbsp;&nbsp;sacrifices everything, including the emotional honesty of her marriage and her own self-aproval, to&nbsp;have a child.&nbsp;&nbsp;And Laura,&nbsp; the&nbsp;precious and beloved daughter,&nbsp; discovers when Anne dies that she has been lied to throughout her life.&nbsp; The relationship of the three women is spiky and difficult and utterly believable.&nbsp; They may be jealous, they are certainly fearful, and they have deep wounds to deal with, but they all, in their own way, try to be&nbsp;reasonable, even to those who can hurt them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Laura, caught up in the consequences of old secrets, does cry out at one point, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s like a contagion, spreading and spreading.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t feel like being fair.&nbsp; No one&rsquo;s been fair to me.&rsquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; But these women are practical and honest and, in the end,&nbsp;Laura&nbsp;<em>is</em> fair, in spite of intense provocation.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is nothing short of heroic.</p>
<p>The most important love affair &ndash; well, this is long-listed for the Romantic Novel of the Year, after all &ndash; is mainly told from the hero&rsquo;s point of view, and is a real heart-turner.&nbsp;&nbsp;He is one of the good guys, quiet and responsible and&nbsp;outshone by flashier&nbsp;chaps &ndash; at least two of them in this book.&nbsp; And then the awful thing happens and he starts to think of himself as a monster.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A rich, understated book of many dimensions -&nbsp; including a whole East Anglian village coming to terms with the wartime arrival of American troops.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; a five&nbsp;handkerchief weepie along the way with,&nbsp;ultimately a&nbsp;&nbsp;deeply satisfying resolution, in which&nbsp;steadfastness is rewarded and endurance&nbsp;justified.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A feast</p>
