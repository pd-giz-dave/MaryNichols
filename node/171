  <div class="content clear-block">
    <p><img width="214" vspace="10" hspace="10" height="320" align="left" src="/sites/default/files/Kirilov%20paperback%20web.jpg" />Here is the last of my monthly blogs for the Australian site: writinghistoricalnovels.com I hope those who have been following them, have found them interesting. I certainly enjoyed doing them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;They say you should write about what you know, especially when you are feeling your way as a writer, but that can be dreadfully restricting and if you did that, you would never write books with historical backgrounds. Think what opportunities you would be missing!  The story is the thing and as long as your research is thorough, there&rsquo;s no reason why you can&rsquo;t attempt something a little more adventurous.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been fascinated by Russian history, ever since I read Tolstoy&rsquo;s War and Peace and Anna Karenina, and Dostoevsky&rsquo;s The Brothers Karamazov and Crime and Punishment as a schoolgirl - in English, I hasten to add. Then later when Dr Zhivago was made into a film it renewed my interest, especially in the Revolution and the terrible fate of the Tsar and his family and the rumours that the Grand Duchess Anastasia had survived. A film was made about it and for a long time it was believed, but this has since been disproved with DNA tests. It was a time of such upheaval that people simply disappeared. The idea for a book simmered in my mind for a long time and though I planned it out, I hesitated to begin writing for fear of biting off more than I could chew.<br />
<br />
When I told my family about it, I began receiving books about Russia for birthday and Christmas presents. That set me collecting books to help with my research, until I had dozens of them. The more I read, the more I became immersed in the history and eventually I couldn&rsquo;t put it off any longer and THE KIRILOV STAR was born</p>
<p>My aristocratic family, distant relatives of the Tsar, are separated when trying to leave Russia during the civil war in 1920. The only survivor is four-year-old Lydia Kirillova, too young and too traumatised to tell anyone what happened and where she comes from.  She knows her name but the only other clue to her identity is a fabulous jewel sewn into her petticoat. She is taken to a British diplomat who has been instructed to oversee the evacuation of the refugees and then leave himself.  He is left wondering what to do with her.</p>
<p>He could send her to a Russian orphanage, but they were notoriously dreadful places and for someone who appears to be of aristocratic stock, it would be worse. He and his wife are childless, something they both regret, could Lydia fill that gap? He could give her a good life, but would his wife accept her? Would Lydia later blame him for taking her from her homeland?</p>
<p>He decides to risk it and Lydia grows up in the privileged background of a stately home and seems content. But Kolya, another Russian &eacute;migr&eacute;, sows the seeds of her discontent and persuades her to marry him and go back to Russia with him to look for her real parents. It is the biggest mistake of her life. Russia under Stalin is a dangerous place for an ex-aristocrat to be. Her husband leaves her for another woman, taking their son, Yuri, with him and she is trying to track him down when the second world war breaks out and her situation becomes desperate. She has left a good home and loving family to chase a dream which turns into a nightmare. She is forced to abandon her search and return to England and only much later when Stalin is dead and it becomes easier to travel is she able to resume her search for her son, helped by the man who has always been in the background of her life and has loved her for years. But when Yuri is finally found, the years apart and the different cultures are not so easy to bridge.</p>
<p>Having written it I wanted someone who was familiar with the country and the times to look at it before I submitted it to my publisher. And here I was lucky. Two of the books I had used for my research were Moscow 1941 and Across the Moscow River, both by Sir Rodric Braithwaite who was British Ambassador to Moscow from 1988 to 1992 and I wrote to him, asking if he would take a look at the typescript. It was a long shot but to my delight he agreed to do so and, besides making some very pertinent comments for which I was very grateful, told me my research had been very thorough and he had no quarrel with it. It just goes to show you should never be afraid to be adventurous. Most people I have approached with queries have been happy to oblige. And taking a chance paid off.</p>
