This is the story of Karl Muller, a German prisoner of war, who is sent to work on an English farm where 
he meets Jean Coleman, the daughter of the farmer. Fraternisation is forbidden between the British people 
and the German POWs except to give instructions, but they ignore that and little by little they draw closer, 
much to the consternation and disapproval of family and friends. Karl, too, suffers at the hands of his 
compatriots.  He is also worried about his family in Germany and Jean is also worried about her brother 
who is a German prisoner of war in Germany. When the peace comes at last, their troubles are far from over.
