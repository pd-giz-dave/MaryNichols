Stella Gardiner has often gone on botanical expeditions with her father and when he is summoned to Trieste 
to confer with Maximilian, Archduke of Austrian Italy, she accompanies him. It is here she meets and falls 
in love with Leo Manfred, Captain of Hussars and court painter. But when Maximilian accepts the throne of 
Mexico, Leo goes with him, leaving a heartbroken Stella. She and her father return to England and Stella 
meets and marries James Wainright. When Maximilian invites Professor Gardiner to join him in Mexico to study 
the plant life, he takes James with him. Her father dies in Mexico under mysterious circumstances but instead 
of coming home James decides to carry on with his work in Mexico. Her mother also dies and Stella finds she 
is almost penniless and sets out for Mexico to search for her husband. But almost the first person she meets 
when she arrives is Leo Manfred.

The country is in great turmoil and is certainly not the place for a lone female and Maximilian orders Leo 
to accompany Stella on her search, much to his chagrin. From the start Stella becomes entangled with the 
troubles of the country, not helped by Leo's apparent reluctance to obey Maximilian's instructions to help 
her find her husband and an American ex-confederate who has made his home in Mexico. Beset by subterfuge, 
danger and hardship, Stella believes only finding her husband and returning to England will cure her of 
her love for Leo. But is she deluding herself?
