<em>Revolutionary France</em>

When the mob, led by Henri Canard, turn on Lisette's father, Comte Giradet, and take him off to prison, 
she doesn't know where to turn for help. Her twin brother, Michel, is close to King Louis, both of whom 
are virtual prisoners of the Revolution and cannot help her. Her only hope is to enlist the help of Sir 
John Challon, an elderly Englishman, who has been exiled in France for over thirty years and longs to be
reunited with his family in England. He writes to his daughter and that is how Commodore John Drymore, 
known as Jay, comes to be in France, risking imprisonment and death at the hands of the Revolutionaries 
in order rescue the Comte from prison and get everyone safely back to England. When Jay makes a second 
trip to rescue Michel, he is disconcerted to find that Lisette has stowed away and insists on accompanying 
him to Paris. She thinks she can help, but is she more of a hindrance than a help?

Those familiar with my Piccadilly Gentlemen's Club series will recognise the name Drymore. Captain James
Drymore was the instigator of the club in The Captain's Mysterious Lady. The Commodore is his son, carrying
on the tradition of the Gentlemen. Sir John Challon, Lady Drymore's father, appeared in the first book as a
follower of the Young Pretender, when he was forced into exile.
