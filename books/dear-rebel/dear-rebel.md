Alys, daughter of Lord Carthorne, has almost forgotten she was betrothed to Sir Garret Hartswood when she was
fourteen, until he comes back into her life again four years later in the middle of the civil war between King
and Parliament. He is a Captain in Cromwell's army and has every intention of holding her to their agreement.
It is no good appealing to her father to be released from it, he is determined to save their home, Waterlea
Manor in the Fens, from sequestration and is not above using the betrothal to do so, knowing Garret will be
duty bound to protect them. Alys rebels but when the war comes to Waterlea, is she risking the lives of her 
father, her brother and the villagers with her stubbornness?
