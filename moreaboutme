<div>Born in Singapore of a Dutch-South African father and an English mother, I came to England when I was three.&nbsp;My father, like many who learn English as a second language, was far more precise in its use than many English people and he would have no sloppiness, either spoken or written, and I put my love of the language down to him.&nbsp;He was also a great reader and there were always books in the house, so that I learned to read at a very early age.&nbsp;By the time I was nine or ten, my one ambition was to be a famous writer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>My first novel was written when I was fifteen, when my parents thought I was shut in my room revising for exams.&nbsp;It was handwritten in several school exercise books and was pretty abysmal.&nbsp;Not having any idea of how to go about finding a publisher, I wrapped it all up and sent it to my mother's monthly magazine!&nbsp;It says a great deal for the editor that she took the trouble to read it and sent me a long and encouraging letter, which put my ambition into over-drive.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>Finishing my education and finding a job took over as priorities in the next year or two, followed by an early marriage and a family and though I managed to find time to write, I did nothing about finding a publisher until my children were all at school.&nbsp;Then I joined the Cambridge Writers' Circle and met people of like mind, some beginners, others with some experience, some who had had work published.&nbsp;My ambition was re-kindled and it has never died since.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Publication of articles and stories in all sorts of periodicals and magazines followed, (one of which was a Western, done for a bet because a male member of the Writers' Circle said women couldn't write Westerns, and of course I had to prove him wrong!), but the ambition to be a novelist never wavered and throughout the time I was writing and selling short pieces I was working on my novels which were invariably rejected with encouraging letters which explained where I had gone wrong.&nbsp;You would be surprised at the number of ways it is possible to go wrong!&nbsp;I joined the Romantic Novelists Association in the 1960s, a wonderful organisation both for aspiring and published authors.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>My first novel was published by Robert Hale in 1981 and that was followed by nine more in the next five years, but my real love was the historical novel and I sent my first historical romance to Mills and Boon in 1985 and was surprised and delighted when a telephone call three weeks later told me it had been accepted.&nbsp;Since then I have been a regular writer for the historical series.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>While writing for Mills &amp; Boon I have been writing sagas/mainstream women's fiction, first for Orion and&nbsp;now Allison&nbsp;and Busby.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also the author of&nbsp;THE MOTHER OF NECTON, a biography of my beloved grandmother, originally published in hardback by&nbsp;Breedon Books in 2000.&nbsp; It has been updated&nbsp;and was re-issued&nbsp;in paperback by The Larks Press in&nbsp;2009. &nbsp;It can also be read as an ebook on Kindle,&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Apart from when my children were small, I always had a 'day job', being a school secretary, an industrial editor and an information manager for a company producing a computer database of&nbsp;distance and open learning courses.&nbsp;Now 'retired' I spend part of every day at my computer writing novels and divide the rest of the time between reading and research, gardening and, when it becomes necessary, housework.&nbsp;Occasionally I give talks about my writing to groups and societies in the area of my home.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;Writing for me is an addiction.&nbsp;I am not happy if I haven't got a book on the go and if my readers enjoy what I have written, that is an added bonus.</div>
<div><span style="line-height: 20.3999996185303px;">I have a son and two daughters and four (now grown-up) grandchildren and three great grandchildren who are real poppits.</span></div>
