Mary's book, <strong><a href="/books/the-farmers-daughter">The Farmer's Daughter</a></strong>,
was published February 2016. This was her final publication as,
with great sadness, we (the family) announce that Mary passed away peacefully on Sunday
7th February 2016 after a short illness. We hope you enjoy her final book.
